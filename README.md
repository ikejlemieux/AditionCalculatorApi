# Addition Calculator API
Welcome to this useless API

- It is somewhat running on replit with the server shutting off automaticly after some time* and having to automaticly power on after a request witch sometimes leads to responding with the HTML of a loading screen(basicly only works if you are lucky) so send a inital request every time before a real request to turn the server on if it is not already

>PLEASE dont DDos the server even though it is on replit -thanks

>due to my free replit account the server automaticly shuts off after some time of no usage
